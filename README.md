# ScienceQuestTeachingPrograms
A series of tutorial code designed to teach basic programming skills to children ages 9-13 through making games in python using pygame.

## Hello World!
Where else could we possibly start? This first excersise gets the students comfortable with interacting with their computer and the development environment. Students are explained the basics of how computer run a series of commands provided to them. All code is extensively commented to serve as a teaching guide for instructors who do not have as much technical expierence.

### Key Concepts:
* running code through terminal using python3 <em>app_name.py</em>
* variables
* printing messages
* extension: recieving user input (proposed idea of text based game to students)

## Pong!
There are 5 pieces of progressivley developing code to implement pong
<ol>
  <li>Step 1: Generates basic window for the game. Re-enforces idea of variables and introduces concept of arrays and loops.</li>
  <li>Step 2: Generates two paddles: Further developes idea of loops (game loop/ redraw). Introduces idea of conditionals to check for user input</li>
  <li>Step 3: adds a ball. reinforces ideas of loop and variable manipulation.</li>
  <li>Step 4: implement collision detection from scratch for ball and paddle, reinforces conditionals, variable manipulation </li>
  <li>Step 5: add in reset button: </li>
</ol>
Allow students to expierement with the game at this point. Suggest options such as changing colour or speed of entities.

### Key Concepts:
* variables
* loops
* conditionals

## Space Invader!
There are 5 pieces of progressivley developing code to implement space invader. This excersise should reinforce many of the concepts from pong, such as how elements move, conditionals, loops, and variables. Main focus should be on further developing the concept of arrays and the introduction of objects. 
<ol>
  <li>Step 1: Generates basic window for the game. Re-enforces idea of variables and introduces concept of arrays and loops.</li>
  <li>Step 2: Generates rectangle player. Reviews concepts from generating paddles</li>
  <li>Step 3: adds in a projectile. introduces idea of objects with special properties such as their apperance, initialization state, and gameloop behavior</li>
  <li>Step 4: add in aliens. This is the main focus of this project. The nature of space invader aliens makes it a prime example of how arrays can be utilized in a "real world" scenario.  </li>
  <li>Step 5: implement pygame collision detection: It would be a bit complicated to explain collision detection for an array of objects to target age group. We leverage pygames build in collision detection. Explain at a high level how modules are prebuild functionality by other deverlopers that we can use.  </li>
</ol>
### Key Concepts:
* arrays
* objects
